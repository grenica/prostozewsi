Prostozewsi is a project connecting organic food producers (farmers) with consumers. It is a platform through which you can order food directly from the farmer. The transaction is in a pre-arranged place and time, which makes it possible to buy really fresh and unprocessed fruit and vegetables while minimizing the producer's losses.

This app used Laravel framework.
